# michelle's personal site

As someone who blabbers way too much, I tried to stick to a very minimal theme with this layout.
It emphasizes more on the visuals and UI/UX than on the words (because no one will read everything that I've typed lol). Lots of annoying tears and lost sleep went into animating and getting all the
assets to align properly (the site isn't even mobile friendly yet, cries).

But yeah, initially wanted to have a penguin floating on a piece of ice but thought that
a penguin on a ship fishing with intent better represents me. And why penguins? Well besides
being my favorite animal, penguins endure hardships just to meet basic needs (ie. male and female have
to take turns waiting for weeks for the other to get food for the other). As someone not from the best family economic situation, I admire them thoroughly and strive to be as perseverant and strong as penguins.

Also, kudos to my friend's workshop. Without the workshop, I would have never been inspired enough
to turn my vision into reality over the weekend.
